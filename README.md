# 🎯 Cyber Threat Intelligence Project – Manchester University (APT33 Case Study)

This project simulates a real-world cyber threat intelligence (CTI) investigation targeting the **education sector**, with a focus on **Manchester University**. As a CTI analyst, I profiled a known threat actor (**APT33**) and simulated a potential attack using open-source intelligence (OSINT), passive reconnaissance, and the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.

---

## 📌 Objective

To gather, analyse, and present actionable threat intelligence by:
- Performing passive reconnaissance on a real-world target
- Profiling a known threat actor (APT33)
- Simulating a realistic attack scenario
- Mapping techniques using MITRE ATT&CK
- Recommending security measures to mitigate risks

---

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques Used

- **TheHarvester** – Passive recon for emails/domains
- **WHOIS**, **DNS lookup**, and open OSINT sources
- **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** – TTP mapping
- **Draw.io** – Attack path diagram
- **MS Word / PowerPoint / PDF** – Reporting & slides

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `/reconnaissance` | Screenshots and summary of passive reconnaissance activities |
| `/threat-actor-profile` | Threat actor dossier: APT33's origin, motives, capabilities |
| `/attack-simulation` | Simulated attack flow using mapped TTPs |
| `/docs` | MITRE ATT&CK full mapping document |
| `/final-report-slides` | Executive summary slide deck (PDF format) |

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Applied **real-world OSINT tools** to gather threat data
- Built a **threat actor profile** using public intelligence
- Simulated a complete **attack scenario** across MITRE ATT&CK stages
- Developed **reporting and communication skills** for CTI

---

## 📄 Deliverables

- ✅ Recon Summary: Public exposure analysis (emails, subdomains, etc.)
- ✅ APT33 Profile: History, past campaigns, capabilities, mapped TTPs
- ✅ Attack Simulation: Visual flow + justification
- ✅ Full Threat Intel Report (Slides)
- ✅ Mitigation Strategies

---

## 🛡️ Recommendations

- Enforce DMARC/DKIM/SPF for email hardening  
- Reduce public service exposure (e.g., VPN portals)  
- Conduct regular OSINT sweeps for domain/email leaks  
- Implement endpoint detection & phishing simulation drills  
- Raise awareness across academic departments
